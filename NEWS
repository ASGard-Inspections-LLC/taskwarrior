New Features in Taskwarrior 2.6.0

  - The 'QUARTER' virtual tag was added.
  - Improved compatibility with SmartOS, OmniOS and OpenIndiana.
  - New DOM references: annotations.count, tw.syncneeded, tw.program, tw.args,
    tw.width, tw.height, tw.version.
  - Renovated 'timesheet' command with a more compact report that accepts a
    filter, and has a default filter showing the last four weeks of completed
    and started tasks.
  - The message telling you to sync now indicates how many local changes will be
    synced.
  - The logic behind new-uuid verbosity option changed. New-uuid now overrides
    new-id if set and will cause Taskwarrior to display UUIDs instead of IDs
    for new tasks (machine friendly).

New Commands in Taskwarrior 2.6.0

  - The 'purge' command was added, which completely removes old tasks.
  - Added new 'history.weekly', 'history.daily', 'ghistory.weekly',
    'ghistory.daily' reports.

New Configuration Options in Taskwarrior 2.6.0

  - The 'default.scheduled' date/duration works just like 'default.due'.
  - The 'report.timesheet.filter' setting controls the tasks shown by the
    'timesheet' command.

Newly Deprecated Features in Taskwarrior 2.6.0

  - The 'DUETODAY' virtual tag is a synonym for the 'TODAY' virtual tag, and is
    not needed.
  - The use of alternate Boolean configuration settings is deprecated. Use values
    "0" for off, and "1" for on.  Avoid used of "on", "off", "true", "t",
    "false", "f", "yes", "y", "no", "n".
  - The 'PARENT' and 'CHILD' virtual tags are replaced by 'TEMPLATE' and 'INSTANCE'.
  - The 'context.program', 'context.args', 'context.width' and 'context.height'
    DOM references are deprecated, replaced by similarly-named 'tw.xxx'
    references.

Removed Features in 2.6.0

  - Removed 'alias._query' default configuration.
