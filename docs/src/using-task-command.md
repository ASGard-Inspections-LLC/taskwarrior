# Using the Task Command

The main interface to your tasks is the `ta` command, which supports various subcommands such as `add`, `modify`, `start`, and `done`.
Customizable [reports](./reports.md) are also available as subcommands, such as `next`.
The command reads a [configuration file](./config-file.md) for its settings, including where to find the task database.
And the `sync` subcommand [synchronizes tasks with a sync server](./task-sync.md).
You can find a list of all subcommands, as well as the built-in reports, with `ta help`.

> NOTE: the `task` interface does not precisely match that of TaskWarrior.
