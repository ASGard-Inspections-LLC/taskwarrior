# Tags

Each task has a collection of associated tags.
Tags are short words that categorize tasks, typically written with a leading `+`, such as `+next` or `+jobsearch`.

Tags are useful for filtering tasks in reports or on the command line.
For example, when it's time to continue the job search, `ta +jobsearch` will show pending tasks with the `jobsearch` tag.

## Allowed Tags

Specifically, tags must be at least one character long and cannot contain whitespace or any of the characters `+-*/(<>^! %=~`.
The first character cannot be a digit, and `:` is not allowed after the first character.
