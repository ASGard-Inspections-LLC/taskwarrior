TaskChampion
------------

TaskChampion is an open-source personal task-tracking application.
Use it to keep track of what you need to do, with a quick command-line interface and flexible sorting and filtering.
It is modeled on [TaskWarrior](https://taskwarrior.org), but not a drop-in replacement for that application.

See:

 * [Development Notes](docs/development-notes.md)
 * [Progress on the first version](https://github.com/djmitche/taskwarrior-rust/projects/1)
